Load Address / Load the PrintFrom address
Store subLowerCaseArg / Store into the subLowerCaseArg
JnS subLowerCase / Store PC at subLowerCase, and jump to Loop
Halt

subLowerCaseArg,HEX 0 / Space for argument
subLowerCase,	HEX 0 / Space for return address

Loop,	LoadI subLowerCaseArg / Load from the address stored in the argument, which actually load the first character
		Store Temp / Store the character into Temp
		Skipcond 400 / Check if the character is zero
		Jump Flag / If not zero, go to Flag
        JumpI subLowerCase/ If the character is zero, then exit the subroutine

Flag,	Subt  A / Use the character subtract HEX 40 (one character before capital A)
		Skipcond 800 / Check to see if the character is behind "@" (will be postive number if behind)
        Jump Output / If it's not postive number, then we know it's not a capital letter, therefore no need to convert, go to the Output label to output
		Load Temp / Load the character again 
		Subt Z / Subtract HEX 5B (one character after capital Z)
        Skipcond 000 / If it's negative, then it means it's a character before "[" & after "@", which is a capital letter from A to Z 
        Jump Output/ If not negative number, then it means it's a character after capital Z, therefore no need to convert, go to the Output label to output
        Load Temp / Start to do the convert
        Add Convert / Add HEX 20 will convert the capital letter to corresponding lower case letter. 
		Output / Output the lower case letter
        
AdrIncrement,	Load subLowerCaseArg 
				Add One
				Store subLowerCaseArg / These three lines increment the address by one, which moves to the next character's address
        		Jump Loop / Jump to the start of the loop
        
Output,	Load Temp / Load the character
		Output / Output the character 
        Jump AdrIncrement / Jump to increment the address

One,	HEX 1
Temp,	HEX 0 / space for a particular character

A,		HEX 40 / Stands for "@", the character before "A"
Z,		HEX 5B / Stands for "[", the character after "Z"
Convert,HEX 20 / use to convert the capital letter to corresponding lower case letter

Address, Adr PrintFrom / Store the address of the string
PrintFrom,	HEX 35 / These hex numbers are "5 A B U N c 5 j" 
			HEX 41
